                <h2>What Is a Front-End Developer ?</h2>
                <p>
                    Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML, 
                    CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. 
                    The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end 
                    of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site they 
                    see the information in a format that is easy to read and relevant. 
                    This is further complicated by the fact that users now use a large variety of 
                    devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into 
                    consideration these aspects when designing the site. They need to ensure that their site comes up correctly 
                    in different browsers (cross-browser), different operating systems (cross-platform) 
                    and different devices (cross-device), which requires careful planning on the side of the developer.

                <h2>What is HTML ?</h2>
                <p>HTML is an acronym which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language which is 
                    used for creating web pages and web applications. 
                    Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hyper Text: HyperText simply means "Text within Text." 
                    A text has a link within it, is a hypertext. 
                    Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, 
                    you have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages 
                    (HTML documents) with each other.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Markup language: A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply 
                    layout and formatting conventions to a text document. 
                    Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. 
                    It can turn text into images, tables, links, etc.

                <h2>What is CSS ?</h2>
                <p>
                    CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language which is used to 
                    describe the look and formatting of a document written in markup language. 
                    It provides an additional feature to HTML. It is generally used with HTML to change 
                    the style of web pages and user interfaces. It can also be used with any kind of XML 
                    documents including plain XML, SVG and XUL.
                </p>
                <p>
                    CSS is used along with HTML and JavaScript in most websites to create user 
                    interfaces for web applications and user interfaces for many mobile applications.

                <h2>What is JavaScript ?</h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which 
                    is used by several websites for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, 
                    full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites 
                    when applied to an HTML document. It was introduced in the year 1995 for adding 
                    programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser. Since then, 
                    it has been adopted by all other graphical web browsers. With JavaScript, 
                    users can build modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the page every time. 
                    The traditional website uses js to provide several forms of interactivity and simplicity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although, JavaScript has no connectivity with Java programming language. 
                    The name was suggested and provided in the times when Java was gaining popularity in the market. 
                    In addition to web browsers, databases such as CouchDB and MongoDB uses JavaScript as their scripting and query language.
